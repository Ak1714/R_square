<b>Exploratory analysis and visualizing to get a feel of the distribution patterns </b>

### Importing packages

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

### Exploratory analysis

Determining the mean and median of the borrowers' months since last public record (mths_since_last_record). Finding the number of observations for which this value is missing and creating a new variable where the value is imputed with the median.

``` r
load("LoanStats2017Q3.rda")
mean(lendingData$mths_since_last_record)
```


    ## [1] NA

Counting number of nulls:

``` r
sum(is.na(lendingData$mths_since_last_record))
```

    ## [1] 103863


Calculating mean without NULL values:
``` r
mean(lendingData$mths_since_last_record, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 75.79589

Calculating the median without null values:
``` r
median(lendingData$mths_since_last_record, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 79

Creating a new column for imputing median in place of NULL. Then imputing median in the new column in place of NULLs:
``` r
medianCol <- c(lendingData$mths_since_last_record)

medianCol[is.na(medianCol)] <- median(medianCol, na.rm = TRUE)

sum(is.na(medianCol))
```

    ## [1] 0


Calculating mean & median for the new column:
``` r
mean(medianCol)
```

    ## [1] 78.50808

``` r
median(medianCol)
```

    ## [1] 79

### Histogram

We plot a histogram for the settlement amount for loans using the function hist();

``` r
hist(lendingData$settlement_amount)
```

The above histogram looks to be right skewed. Also, the column has a large range between $331.44 to $24102, it makes sense to do a log transformation to make it closer to a normal distribution. The below histogram appears to be close to a normal distribution.

``` r
logSettleamt <- log(lendingData$settlement_amount)
hist(logSettleamt, labels=TRUE)
```

### Boxplot

Creating a boxplot of interest rate (int_rate) for each loan status (loan_status) to find the status that has loans with the highest median interest rate:

``` r
boxplot(lendingData$int_rate ~ lendingData$loan_status, col = 6, labels = TRUE, las = 2, par(mar=c(8,5,2,2)))
```

<img src="https://github.com/Ak1714/R_square/blob/master/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png?raw=true" width="500">

The median values for all loan statuses are summarized below using dplyr and group_by:
``` r
lendingData %>%
              dplyr::select(loan_status, int_rate) %>%
              group_by(loan_status) %>%
              summarize(medianVal = median(int_rate, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
              arrange(loan_status)
```

    ## # A tibble: 7 x 2
    ##   loan_status        medianVal
    ##   <fct>                  <dbl>
    ## 1 Charged Off             15.0
    ## 2 Current                 12.0
    ## 3 Default                 15.0
    ## 4 Fully Paid              12.6
    ## 5 In Grace Period         14.1
    ## 6 Late (16-30 days)       14.1
    ## 7 Late (31-120 days)      15.0


From the boxplot, loan statuses: Charged Off, Default and Late (31-120 days) tend to have the highest median interest rates since these borrowers havenâ€™t been able to pay their interests on time. The interest rates for Fully Paid loans are lower than those of Charged Off ones.
