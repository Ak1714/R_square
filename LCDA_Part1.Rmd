```{r Loading .rda file}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

load("LoanStats2017Q3.rda")

#Determining the mean and median of the borrowers' months since last public record (mths_since_last_record). Finding the number of observations for which this value is missing and creating a new variable where the value is imputed with the median.

mean(lendingData$mths_since_last_record)

# Counting number of nulls = 103863
sum(is.na(lendingData$mths_since_last_record))

# Calculating mean without NULL values = 75.79589
mean(lendingData$mths_since_last_record, na.rm = TRUE)

# Calculating the median without null values = 79
median(lendingData$mths_since_last_record, na.rm = TRUE)

# creating a new column for imputing median in place of NULL
medianCol <- c(lendingData$mths_since_last_record)

# Imputing median in the new column in place of NULLs
medianCol[is.na(medianCol)] <- median(medianCol, na.rm = TRUE)

# Counting NULLs after imputation = 0
sum(is.na(medianCol))

# Calculating mean = 78.50808 & median = 79 for the new column
mean(medianCol)
median(medianCol)
```

## Histograms and Boxplots

```{r histogram, echo=FALSE}
# Plotting a histogram of the settlement amount for loans (for those with a settlement) to determine if the distribution is skewed.  
# creating a transformation of the settlement amount data and then plotting histogram of the result.  

hist(lendingData$settlement_amount) # The histogram looks to be right skewed

# The above histogram looks to be right skewed. Also, the column has a large range between $331.44 to $24102, it makes sense to do a log transformation to make it closer to a normal distribution

logSettleamt <- log(lendingData$settlement_amount)
hist(logSettleamt, labels=TRUE)

# The below histogram appears to be close to a normal distribution


```
```{r}
# Creating a boxplot of interest rate (int_rate) for each loan status (loan_status) to find the status that has loans with the highest median interest rate  

boxplot(lendingData$int_rate ~ lendingData$loan_status, col = 6, labels = TRUE, las = 2, par(mar=c(8,5,2,2)))

# Verifying median values

lendingData %>%
              dplyr::select(loan_status, int_rate) %>%
              group_by(loan_status) %>%
              summarize(medianVal = median(int_rate, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
              arrange(loan_status)
              
# Loan statuses: Charged Off, Default and Late (31-120 days) tend to have the highest median interest rates since these borrowers havenâ€™t been able to pay their interests on time.
# The interest rates for Fully Paid loans are lower than those of Charged Off ones.

  
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
